# :camel: camel-final-fantasy-party-builder
Project used to learn the basics of Apache Camel integration framework and to work like a Final Fantasy party building application.

Highly inspired by [jntpablo's introducao-apache-camel](https://github.com/jntpablo/introducao-apache-camel)

Divided in one Camel Application(camel-party-builder) and one API(party-builder-service) for saving data sent by Camel.
